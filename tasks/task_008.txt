# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Imaging API Endpoints
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create backend API endpoints for managing medical imaging data, including upload, retrieval, and metadata management.
# Details:
Implement FastAPI endpoints:
- GET /imaging/{patient_id} - List all images for a patient
- GET /imaging/{image_id} - Get specific image metadata
- GET /imaging/file/{image_id} - Stream image file from object storage
- POST /imaging - Upload new image with metadata (admin/researcher only)
- DELETE /imaging/{image_id} - Delete image (admin only)
Integrate with MinIO/S3 for object storage of image files.

# Test Strategy:
Test image upload and retrieval flow. Verify correct metadata storage in database and file storage in object storage. Test authorization with different user roles.
