# Status: done
# Dependencies: 10, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the Execute component of the MAPE-K adaptation engine and integrate it with the frontend to enable adaptive UI.
# Details:
Implement:
- Backend API endpoint to serve adaptation plans
- Frontend service to fetch and apply adaptation plans
- React components that respond to adaptation plans by:
  - Reordering sections based on priority
  - Adjusting suggestion density
  - Highlighting relevant sections
  - Applying other UI adaptations
- Implement smooth transitions between UI states
Ensure all adaptations are visible to the user and can be reset if needed.

# Test Strategy:
Test frontend adaptation with different adaptation plans. Verify correct reordering of sections and UI adjustments. Test transitions between different UI states. Verify user awareness of adaptations.
