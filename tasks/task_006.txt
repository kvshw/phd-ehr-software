# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Patient CRUD API Endpoints
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create backend API endpoints for patient data management, including listing, searching, and retrieving patient details.
# Details:
Implement FastAPI endpoints:
- GET /patients - List all patients with pagination and filtering
- GET /patients/{id} - Get detailed patient information
- POST /patients - Create new synthetic patient (admin only)
- PUT /patients/{id} - Update patient information (admin only)
- DELETE /patients/{id} - Delete patient (admin only)
- GET /patients/search - Search patients by various criteria
Ensure proper role-based access control for each endpoint.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test each endpoint for correct data handling. Test authorization with different user roles. Test pagination, filtering, and search functionality.
