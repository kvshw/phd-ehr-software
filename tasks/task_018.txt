# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement AI Service Routing in Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 15, 16, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Create backend API endpoints that route requests to the appropriate AI model services and handle responses.
# Details:
Implement FastAPI endpoints:
- POST /ai/vitals-risk - Routes to vital risk model service
- POST /ai/image-analysis - Routes to image analysis model service
- POST /ai/diagnosis-helper - Routes to diagnosis suggestion service
- POST /ai/summarize (optional) - Routes to LLM summarizer service
Implement proper error handling, timeout management, and response caching where appropriate. Ensure all AI outputs are stored in the database for audit and research purposes.

# Test Strategy:
Test routing to each model service. Verify correct handling of responses and errors. Test timeout scenarios. Verify database storage of AI outputs.
