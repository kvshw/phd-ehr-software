# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Image Analysis Model Service
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the image analysis model service that processes medical images and produces abnormality assessments with heatmaps.
# Details:
Implement a Python service that:
- Exposes an API endpoint for image analysis
- Accepts input of image ID and type (X-ray/MRI)
- Implements a rule-based or simple ML model for image analysis
- Generates heatmaps highlighting areas of interest
- Returns structured output with abnormality score, classification, heatmap URL, and explanation
- Includes proper logging and error handling
- Follows the output format specified in the PRD
- Includes model version information
Package as a Docker container.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test image analysis logic with different input images. Test API endpoint with valid and invalid inputs. Verify output format matches PRD specification. Test heatmap generation. Test containerization.
