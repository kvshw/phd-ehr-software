# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement MAPE-K Analyze and Plan Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the Analyze and Plan components of the MAPE-K adaptation engine that process monitoring data and generate adaptation plans.
# Details:
Implement Python services that:
- Analyze collected monitoring data
- Apply rules for UI adaptation, such as:
  - If clinician consistently scrolls to vitals → raise its priority
  - If image flags high → move imaging up
  - If many suggestions are ignored → reduce frequency
- Generate JSON layout plans with section ordering and suggestion density
- Store adaptation plans in the database
- Implement proper error handling and logging
Ensure all adaptation rules are transparent and explainable.

# Test Strategy:
Test analysis logic with different monitoring data scenarios. Verify correct generation of adaptation plans. Test rule application and priority determination. Verify database storage of adaptation plans.
