# Title: Implement Diagnosis Suggestion Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the diagnosis suggestion service that provides rule-based clinical suggestions with explanations.
# Details:
Implement a Python service that:
- Exposes an API endpoint for diagnosis suggestions
- Accepts patient data including vitals, labs, and diagnoses
- Implements rule-based logic for generating suggestions
- Returns structured output with suggestions, confidence scores, sources, and explanations
- Includes proper logging and error handling
- Follows the output format specified in the PRD
- Ensures all suggestions include clear explanations
- Includes safety checks to prevent prescriptive suggestions
Package as a Docker container.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test suggestion logic with different patient scenarios. Test API endpoint with valid and invalid inputs. Verify output format matches PRD specification. Test safety checks for prescriptive language. Test containerization.
