# Title: Implement Logging and Audit Trail System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18, 19, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a comprehensive logging and audit trail system for user actions, AI suggestions, and system adaptations.
# Details:
Implement:
- Backend API endpoints for log retrieval
- Structured logging format for all system events
- User action logging (views, clicks, navigation)
- AI suggestion logging (presentation, user response)
- Adaptation logging (triggers, plans, executions)
- Ensure all logs are timestamped and associated with users

Ensure no PHI or identifiable information is logged.

# Test Strategy:
Test log generation for different system events. Verify correct storage and retrieval of logs. Test log format and content. Verify no PHI is captured in logs.
