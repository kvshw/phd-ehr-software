# Task ID: 3
# Title: Setup Docker Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create Docker configuration files for development and deployment environments, including docker-compose.yml and Dockerfiles for frontend, backend, and model services.
# Details:
Create the following files:
- docker-compose.yml: Define services for frontend (Next.js), backend (FastAPI), PostgreSQL database, MinIO/S3 for object storage, and model services
- Dockerfile.frontend: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- Dockerfile.backend: FastAPI with Python dependencies
- Dockerfile.model: Base image for model services with necessary ML libraries
Ensure proper networking between services and volume mounts for persistent data.

# Test Strategy:
Test docker-compose up to ensure all services start correctly. Verify network connectivity between services and proper volume mounting.
