# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Vital Risk Model Service
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the vital risk prediction model service that analyzes vital signs trends and produces risk assessments.
# Details:
Implement a Python service that:
- Exposes an API endpoint for vital risk prediction
- Accepts input of most recent 12-hour vital trends
- Implements a rule-based or simple ML model for risk assessment
- Returns structured output with risk level, score, top features, and explanation
- Includes proper logging and error handling
- Follows the output format specified in the PRD
- Includes model version information
Package as a Docker container.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test risk prediction logic with different input scenarios. Test API endpoint with valid and invalid inputs. Verify output format matches PRD specification. Test containerization.
