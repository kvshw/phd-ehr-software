# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
This platform serves as a research testbed for studying:
- Cognitive load reduction in clinical workflows
- Trust & interpretability of AI-assisted medical systems
- Bias, fairness, and risk management in medical AI
- Self-adaptive system behaviors in healthcare contexts

## Problems It Solves
1. **Cognitive Overload**: Clinicians face information overload when reviewing patient records
2. **AI Transparency**: Need for explainable AI in medical contexts
3. **Adaptive Interfaces**: Research into how systems can adapt to user behavior
4. **Safe AI Integration**: Testing ground for safe, privacy-centric medical AI

## How It Should Work
1. Clinicians log in and see a prioritized patient list
2. Clicking a patient shows detailed view with:
   - Demographics, vitals, labs, imaging
   - AI-generated suggestions with explanations
   - Adaptive layout that responds to context
3. System monitors behavior and adapts UI layout
4. Researchers can analyze logs and system behavior

## User Experience Goals
- **Simple & Clear**: Minimal cognitive load, intuitive navigation
- **Helpful, Not Overwhelming**: Suggestions are contextual and explainable
- **Safe & Transparent**: All AI outputs clearly labeled as experimental
- **Fast & Responsive**: Quick access to critical information

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Clinicians (Orthopaedics / General Medicine)
- **Secondary**: Researchers / PhD Team
- **Tertiary**: Admin / Engineers
